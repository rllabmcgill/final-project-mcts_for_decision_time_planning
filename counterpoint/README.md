See trace_0.wav for an example rendering, using Timidity. All .mid and .ly files are included in saved_*

For viewing .ly files, in Linux lilypond is usually used, the pdf output can be created using `lilypond file.ly`. .mid files require a midi player, in Linux timidity is a common choice. After installing timidity, the audio can be heard using `timidity file.mid`.
